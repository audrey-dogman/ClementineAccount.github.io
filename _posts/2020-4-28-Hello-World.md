Hello World!  
  
I will update this site with whatever I find interesting over time. I am painterested in writing blog posts on Game Engines and Game Engine Development.  
  
A site like this should be more organized than a social media site, anyways.

Will work on polishing up and cleaning this site over time. For now I am going to be a bit more casual about it...
